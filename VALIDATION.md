# Validation log

Only executed checks are listed. Each entry names the revision it ran against, how it ran, and the result.
"Working tree on X" means uncommitted changes on top of commit X that were committed in the next checkpoint.
Machine: owner's Windows 11 Pro workstation, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080, Unity 6000.6.3f1.

## V-001 — Repository, remote and first push (2026-09-26)
- Revision: `062bd57` (baseline setup commit on `dev/night-signal`, parent `7a5e268`).
- Checked: working directory = Git root = Unity project root; single worktree; remote
  `https://github.com/A-Birdi/Night-Signal.git` (racing project, no embedded credentials).
- `git push -u origin dev/night-signal` → new branch; `git ls-remote` SHA = local HEAD `062bd57a5d8b…`. **Pass.**

## V-002 — Package cleanup through Package Manager (2026-09-26)
- Revision: working tree on `062bd57`.
- Removed `com.unity.ai.assistant`, `com.unity.pipeline`, `com.unity.ai.inference` via MCP `manage_packages`
  (each job `succeeded`); Package Manager dropped `com.unity.dt.app-ui`, `com.unity.2d.sprite`,
  `com.unity.mathematics` from the lockfile. Editor reconnected after each domain reload
  (`mcpforunity://instances` → one instance, `Night Signal@6e8641e8562575b3`, project root unchanged).
- Console after resolution: 0 errors, 0 warnings. The earlier `NoSubscription` exceptions and
  "Claude CLI not found" entry did not recur after the reloads. **Pass.**

## V-003 — Editor write + rendered capture through the bridge (2026-09-26)
- Revision: working tree on `062bd57`.
- Created `Assets/Tests/Verification/SetupSmoke.unity` (camera, directional light, ground, spin target,
  `SmokeTestRunner`) and two URP/Lit materials with MCP tools, saved the scene, captured the Main Camera.
- Evidence: `Evidence/setup/editor-smoke-camera.png` (640×360, URP Lit shading, soft shadow). **Pass.**

## V-004 — EditMode and PlayMode tests (2026-09-26)
- Revision: working tree on `062bd57`.
- `NightSignal.Tests.EditMode`: 5/5 passed (editor version pin, Graphics default URP asset, all quality levels
  URP, Linear colour space, smoke scene contents).
- `NightSignal.Tests.PlayMode`: 1/1 passed (`SmokeScene_RunsUnderUrpAndAnimates`: URP active, update loop
  rotates the target > 5° in 0.5 s).
- Note: the EditMode scene test was then hardened (do not close a scene the developer had open) after this
  run; re-run recorded in V-007.

## V-005 — Windows development player build (2026-09-26)
- Revision: working tree on `062bd57`.
- MCP `manage_build`: StandaloneWindows64, player subtarget, Development, scene `SetupSmoke` →
  `Builds/SetupSmoke/NightSignalSmoke.exe`. Result **Succeeded**, 238 s, 168.27 MB, 0 errors in summary,
  2 warnings. Console also logged two "All SubShaders were stripped" errors for
  `Hidden/Core/DebugOccluder` and `Hidden/Core/DebugOcclusionTest` (see `docs/UNITY_SETUP.md`).

## V-006 — Launch of the built player (2026-09-26)
- Binary from V-005, launched as a separate process with `-nsSmokeTest -nsSmokeFrames 180`, windowed 1280×720.
- Exit code **0** after 18.7 s wall time. Report `Evidence/setup/player-smoke.json`: WindowsPlayer,
  development build, `UniversalRenderPipelineAsset` / `PC_RPAsset`, Direct3D11, Linear, 180 frames,
  non-black pixel fraction 1.0, target rotated 109°. Screenshot `Evidence/setup/player-smoke.png`.
- The 40 fps average covers the first 4.5 s after launch of a development build and is **not** a
  performance measurement.
